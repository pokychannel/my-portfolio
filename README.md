# hello! :shipit:

My name is Laura. I am a Computer Science nerd who loves to solve logical problems,
from silly riddles and rubik's cubes to complex mathematical problems and coding challenges. 

Through out my career, I got the chance to explore and learn about the vast reach of computer 
programming: Artificial Inteligente, Data Science, Robotics, Computer Graphics and more! 

As I keep learning, I want this portfolio to remind me of how much I've improved over the years
and to inspire me to think of all the things I have yet to master.

I also hope that my small contribution to this community will be useful to at least one student 
looking for code that they can copy and paste onto their homework (you know we've all been there).
